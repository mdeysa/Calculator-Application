# Calculator-Application
This is a working calculator with a windows form, with all necessary buttons.
There is code that works for resizing for the user, so if the user expands or makes the form smaller the buttons will follow and stay in place while being resized. 
Keyboard input code is also implemented which allows the user to use the keyboard in order to input numbers into the calculator.
